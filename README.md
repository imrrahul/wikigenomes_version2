# wikigenomes_version2
Wikidata is a recently developed project of the
Wikimedia Foundation 
New Layout and design, built on AngularJs
I have forked this repository from Putmantime https://github.com/putmantime/wikigenomes_version2 as it is very useful for those researchers who are
working on Biological research projects such gene-sequencing. This project can be accessed at http://wikigenomes.org/ and Can be used for downloaded annotated dataset for various organisms and diseases dataset.
It provides dataset which consists of gene-sequencing can be used for various deep learning techniques and machine learning predictions.
Here, we describe WikiGenomes (wikigenomes.org), a web
application that facilitates the consumption and curation of genomic data by the entire
scientific community. WikiGenomes is based on Wikidata, an openly editable knowledge
graph with the goal of aggregating published knowledge into a free and open database.
WikiGenomes empowers the individual genomic researcher to contribute their expertise
to the curation effort and integrates the knowledge into Wikidata, enabling it to be accessed by anyone without restriction.

Here, we describe WikiGenomes (www.wikigenomes.org), the first domain-specific application built on
Wikidata, tailored to the needs of biomedical researchers.
WikiGenomes is a Web application that is designed and
built to allow the genomic researcher to contribute to
curating the knowledge they are discovering. It facilitates
both the consumption and community curation of genomic
data in Wikidata, extending the reach of the biocuration
effort deeper into the long tail of sequenced genomes

It provides biomedical knowledge in a structured, queryable and computable format (5, 12).
Previously, we loaded genomic data from a variety of organisms including Homo sapiens ‘human’ (www.wikidata.
org/wiki/Q15978631), Mus musculus ‘mouse’ (www.wiki
data.org/wiki/Q83310), Rattus norvegicus ‘brown rat’
(www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184224), Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c ‘baker’s yeast’ (www.wikidata.org/wiki/
Q27510868) and Macaca nemestrina ‘Southern pig-tailed macaque’ (www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q618026). In this
work, we systematically expanded this list to include all
genes (390 719) and proteins (372 178) from 120 NCBI
prokaryotic reference genomes (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/genome/browse/reference/) (Figure 1). These organisms are all reasonably well-studied, but in general did not
have community-maintained genome databases. In addition to organism/genetic data, we contribute to and maintain data for proteins, chemical compounds and disease.
