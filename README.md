# wikigenomes_version2
Wikidata is a recently developed project of the
Wikimedia Foundation 
New Layout and design, built on AngularJs
I have forked this repository from Putmantime https://github.com/putmantime/wikigenomes_version2 as it is very useful for those researchers who are
working on Biological research projects such gene-sequencing. This project can be accessed at http://wikigenomes.org/ and Can be used for downloaded annotated dataset for various organisms and diseases dataset.
It provides dataset which consists of gene-sequencing can be used for various deep learning techniques and machine learning predictions.
Here, we describe WikiGenomes (wikigenomes.org), a web
application that facilitates the consumption and curation of genomic data by the entire
scientific community. WikiGenomes is based on Wikidata, an openly editable knowledge
graph with the goal of aggregating published knowledge into a free and open database.
WikiGenomes empowers the individual genomic researcher to contribute their expertise
to the curation effort and integrates the knowledge into Wikidata, enabling it to be accessed by anyone without restriction.
